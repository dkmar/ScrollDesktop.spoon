Scrollable window manager for Mac OS X.  With the pointer above the
desktop or the Command key pressed, scroll left or right to move
windows across a virtual infinitely wide horizontal plane.

When Shift is held, the window under the cursor stays in place.
When Option is held, only the window under the pointer is scrolled.

ScrollDesktop is a plugin for [Hammerspoon] and is inspired by
[PaperWM.spoon].
